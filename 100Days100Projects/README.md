# 100 Days 100 Projects

I wrote about [why I started this challenge](https://maupanelo.com/posts/im-committing-to-a-new-challenge-starting-today/).

tl;dr - I want to be a better front-end developer and I was inspired by [Florin Pop](https://www.florin-pop.com/blog/2019/09/100-days-100-projects/).

I started this challenge on March 1, 2022. 

I'm also taking inspiration from Florin's work because I'm a newbie, and I need some hand-holding.
