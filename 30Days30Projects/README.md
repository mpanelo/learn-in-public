# 30 Days 30 Projects

### Update (03/08/2022):
I'm changing the challenge from 100 days to 30 days. 100 days is too extreme for me, but I still want a challenge, and 30 days is the perfect fit for me.

## Why Am I Doing This?
tl;dr - I want to be a better front-end developer and I was inspired by [Florin Pop](https://www.florin-pop.com/blog/2019/09/100-days-100-projects/).

Here's a ~250 word explanation on [why I'm doing this.](https://maupanelo.com/posts/im-committing-to-a-new-challenge-starting-today/) 

Side note: I'm taking inspiration from Florin's work because I'm a newbie, and I need some hand-holding.
